# Clown Game

The Clown Game is simple:

The game starts out with a list of clowns. As each clown is added to the list, it is set to either sitting or standing.
You can then flip any clown in the list of clowns (by clicking on its image), but in doing so, you also flip the clown on either side of that clown!
You win the game when you make all the clowns standing.

*Learning Goals*

This assignment requires you to use the following Java syntax:

- method invocation (e.g., clown.isStanding(); clownList.flip(3);)
- variable assignment statements (e.g., x=5; state=false;)
- statements involving arithmetic and/or logical operators (e.g., x + y or x < y;)
- conditional branching (e.g., if (...) statement)
- foreach loops
- list operations:
	- the list.get(x) method returns the object held at position x in the list. For instance: myClown = clowns.get(0);returns the 0th Clown in the list clowns, and saves it to the variable myClown.
	- the list.add(m) method adds the object m to the list. So saying clowns.add(c) would add Clown c to the list clowns.

If you find yourself trying to use additional syntax, talk to someone. You might be making it too hard!

## Task 1

Run the game and familiarize yourself with the codebase.

We have provided you with a broken implementation of the Clown Game. It has a functioning user interface (in the uipackage), and functioning (but incomplete) tests, but it is almost entirely missing the method implementations of the ListOfClowns class and of the Clown class.

It is your job to implement all the missing methods according to the specifications provided (see Task 2).
______
## Task 2

Complete the implementation of the ListOfClowns and Clown classes so that they adhere to the specifications provided.
Hint: No need to change any method unless we have put a TODO comment above it. There are also comments written in the form REQUIRES, MODIFIES and EFFECTS. You will soon be learning about what these mean, but for now,
    - REQUIRES indicates anything that needs to be true prior to the method running, or any constraints on parameters (if they have to be in a certain range, for instance),
    - MODIFIES indicates what data is changed by the method, and
    - EFFECTS describes what the method should accomplish.

Notes:
    When you open the project in the Packages view, you will find three packages: ui, tests and model. You ONLY need to modify the classes in the model package. Leave the ui package untouched.
    You may add new tests or modify existing tests in the tests package as you like but it is not a requirement for this assignment. Your tests will not be marked.
    We encourage you to read the tests in the tests package however. They may give you hints about how the methods are meant to work (the specifications are the best way to work that out but sometimes it's nice to have the usage context)
______
## Task 3

Once enough of the implementation is working, you should be able to play the game by running the ClownGame class in the ui package!! Have fun!
